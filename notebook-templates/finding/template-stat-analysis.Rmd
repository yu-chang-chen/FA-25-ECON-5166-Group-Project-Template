```{r}
# Load input data here and please finish all the data manipulation here.
# Finish this block by printing the first ten observations of the data.
# Note:
# - You may only read data from /data/processed.
# - Files in /data/processed should already be cleaned and prepared for analysis.
# - Beyond simple filtering of observations or generating a small number of variables,
#   further data manipulation is not allowed. If more extensive changes are needed,
#   update the source data instead.
```

```{r}
# Before conducting the analysis, report summary statistics for all variables 
# that will be used in this notebook:
#   - For numeric variables: mean, min, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, 
#     max, standard deviation, and number of observations.
#   - For categorical variables: number of observations and the counts/percentages 
#     of the ten most frequent categories.
# Conclude this block with the complete summary statistics.
```
